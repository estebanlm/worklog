I'm a log event. 
I have a moment (date), and a message.

logs are the fundamental element of worklog application. 
they keep a unit of log  who is basically the purpose of all this :)

In the future, I can have also an user references (in case I want to create multiuser logs)

Of course, I'm a toot class and I have many queries that can be done (see my class side  methods)
