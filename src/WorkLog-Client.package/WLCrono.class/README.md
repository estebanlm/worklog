I'm a small tool to keep a daily log. 
I don't know if I will be useful, but Esteban sometimes wants to keep track of all stupid actions he do, without needing to publish them each time (ideally, he will be publishing a digest of this, using WorkLog ).

So far, I just know ==#log:==, which appends an entry to the daily log.
